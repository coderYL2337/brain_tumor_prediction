Users are able to upload a brain scan image and select a model to read the scanned image and predict if it is a tumor and what type of tumor it is.
Polygraph and bar charts are used to visualize the percentage of probability and machine model confidence.
Gemini AI is used to interpret the result and give user explanation.
